# Text Mining: Final Project

Your task is to find two interesting products, applications, or tools that make use of text mining techniques that we've learned about in this class. You are expected to describe the application, list what techniques from the class they might be using to produce their result, and explain how those techniques would be used in the product.

You are expected to write 1000-2000 words. Be concise, don't add more words just for the sake of making your report seem longer.

The specific things that will be marked (see the rubric for more detail):

Are the applications novel? Choose something we have not directly discussed in this class
Description of the applications chosen
Plausibility that the techniques you list are used by the applications (you will not be penalized for being wrong, but the techniques have to be possibly part of that product)
Description of the techniques
Explanation of how the techniques would be used in the application

# Applications of Text Mining for Insurance Related Products

The insurance industry is one that is increasingly competitive, evolving and adapting. My wife works for 
an independent, non-profit research firm that gathers data from the entire industry and elsewhere and 
creates products for their member insurance companies. Their applications of text mining techniques
are on the rise and include two interesting products that are currently in development. As they are 
unreleased and proprietary, the readers’ discretion is requested. Due to their sensitive nature, the only 
request of their project managers was to know the likely inputs and the desired outcomes. These and 
the plausible techniques incorporated are discussed below for Candidate Sentiment Analysis and Emerging Topic Modeling.
