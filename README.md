# Text-Mining-Insurance

Your task is to find two interesting products, applications, or tools that make use of text mining techniques that we've learned about in this class. You are expected to describe the application, list what techniques from the class they might be using to produce their result, and explain how those techniques would be used in the product.

You are expected to write 1000-2000 words. Be concise, don't add more words just for the sake of making your report seem longer.

The specific things that will be marked (see the rubric for more detail):

Are the applications novel? Choose something we have not directly discussed in this class
Description of the applications chosen
Plausibility that the techniques you list are used by the applications (you will not be penalized for being wrong, but the techniques have to be possibly part of that product)
Description of the techniques
Explanation of how the techniques would be used in the application
